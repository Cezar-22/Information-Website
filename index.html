			<h2>What are computers</h2>
			<p>
				Computers are people created machines dsigned to help people do every-day work and make their lives easier. But as time passed and world evolved, Computers are now used for pretty much everything. This means calculation, documentation, database, storage, server hosting and even games.

			<h2>How computers work</h2>
			<p>
				Computers run operating systems and operating systems run applications. For an application to run and work properly on a computer, it has to be written in a programming language by a programmer. After that, the code written by the programmer has to be compiled, which means transformed from programming language that people understand to bite code that computers understand. The first program wasn't written in a programming language, it was written in raw bite code. After that, they began writing programs in programming languages that were transformed into bite code to run on computers. This helped a lot in computer programming history. Many new programs appeared and, soon, everyone could make their own program. All they had to know was a programming language and how to compile it.
